                    Diabetes is a chronic medical condition where the body is unable to properly process food for use as energy. It affects how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). High blood sugar levels can lead to serious health problems if not managed properly.

                                This type occurs when the body's immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. It is usually diagnosed in children and young adults.
